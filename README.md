# ITALY HOUSE PRICES 
I created this repo to automate the scraping of housing data in Italy, from the [Immobiliare website](https://www.immobiliare.it/)

Data are public and available [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/italy-housing-data;tab=objects?forceOnBucketsSortingFiltering=true&inv=1&invt=AblAnQ&project=italy-housing&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false)

I also did a small Streamlit a to see house prices in Italy by city and over time
